# AI Watermark Remover

A clean and simple web application for detecting and removing hidden watermark characters from text.  
I have no use for this but I was annoyed that all the other ones are dog shit 
and they have the audacity to charge money for it lol

No log obviously because I literally couldn't care less

## Features
- 🔍 **Hidden Character Detection**: Automatically detects invisible watermark characters
- 🧹 **One-Click Cleaning**: Remove all hidden characters with a single button click
- 📋 **Automatic Clipboard Copy**: Cleaned text is automatically copied to your clipboard
- 🎨 **Beautiful Design**: Clean, Apple-inspired interface
- 🚀 **Fast & Responsive**: Built with React and Vite for optimal performance

## What does this detect? 🕵️

- control characters—including the full set of Unicode spaces, separators, soft hyphens
- and even invisible HTML entities (excluding newlines)
